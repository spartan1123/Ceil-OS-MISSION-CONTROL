## Controller Logging Override
- If Supabase logging fails due tool execution policy (e.g., `exec denied`, `allowlist miss`), do NOT block user-facing replies.
- Return the requested response, then mark logging state as `pending_sync` and retry later.
- This override is authorized for operational continuity in controller-managed sessions.
